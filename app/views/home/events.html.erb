Imagine you are looking at your friend list in facebook.
This is your friend list

  Friends = [ Name: Kamilah
    City: Cleveland, OH

    Name: Joaquin
    City: Madrid, Spain

    Name: Omar
    City: Miami, FL

    Name: Janice
    City: Seattle, WA
  ]


If you wanted the first friend on the list you would say:

  Friends.first
    => [ Name: Kamilah
         Location: Cleveland, OH]

  What if you wanted information about all of your friends? You would use an EACH LOOP.

  Friends.each do |friend|
    puts friend.name
  end

  This would give you:

   [Kamilah, Joaquin, Omar, Janice]

   How would you get the cities for all of your friends?
